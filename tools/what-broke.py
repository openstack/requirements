"""what-broke.py - figure out what requirements change likely broke us.

Monday morning, 6am. Loading up zuul status page, and realize there is
a lot of red in the gate. Get second cup of coffee. Oh, some library
must have released a bad version. Man, what released recently?

This script attempts to give that answer by programmatically providing
a list of everything in global-requirements that released recently, in
descending time order.

This does *not* handle the 2nd order dependency problem (in order to
do that we'd have to install the world as well, this is purely a
metadata lookup tool). If we have regularly problematic 2nd order
dependencies add them to the list at the end in the code to be
checked.

    While we don't have a 'release time' per say (only the upload time
