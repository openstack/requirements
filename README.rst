Security Warning
================

OpenStack makes no security guarantees about third-party
dependencies listed here, and does not keep track of any
vulnerabilities they contain. Versions of these dependencies are
frozen at each coordinated release in order to stabilize upstream
testing, and can contain known vulnerabilities. Consumers are
*STRONGLY* encouraged to rely on curated distributions of OpenStack
or manage security patching of dependencies themselves.
